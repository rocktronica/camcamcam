# camcamcam

Web wrapper for FaceTime or Raspberry Pi camera, mostly to make sure my cat is eating her food when I'm away!

```shell
# If on Mac, install camera utility
brew install imagesnap

# If on Pi, enable camera addon in config
sudo raspi-config

# Install flask for python
pip install flask

# Run the app w/ help to see full argument list
python app.py -h
```

Work-in-progress, but MIT license nonetheless
